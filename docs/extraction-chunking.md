Chunking strategies are critical for dividing large texts into manageable parts, enabling effective content processing and extraction. These strategies are foundational in cosine similarity-based extraction techniques, which allow users to retrieve only the most relevant chunks of content for a given query. Additionally, they facilitate direct integration into RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems for structured and scalable workflows.
1. **Cosine Similarity and Query Relevance** : Prepares chunks for semantic similarity analysis. 2. : Seamlessly processes and stores chunks for retrieval. 3. : Allows for diverse segmentation methods, such as sentence-based, topic-based, or windowed approaches.
Splits text based on regular expression patterns, useful for coarse segmentation.
```
 :
   ():
    self.patterns = patterns  [] # Default pattern for paragraphs
   ():
    paragraphs = [text]
     pattern  self.patterns:
      paragraphs = [seg  p  paragraphs  seg  re.split(pattern, p)]
     paragraphs

text = """This is the first paragraph.
This is the second paragraph."""
chunker = RegexChunking()
(chunker.chunk(text))

```

Divides text into sentences using NLP tools, ideal for extracting meaningful statements.
```
 nltk.tokenize  sent_tokenize
 :
   ():
    sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
     [sentence.strip()  sentence  sentences]

text = "This is sentence one. This is sentence two."
chunker = NlpSentenceChunking()
(chunker.chunk(text))

```

Uses algorithms like TextTiling to create topic-coherent chunks.
```
 nltk.tokenize  TextTilingTokenizer
 :
   ():
    self.tokenizer = TextTilingTokenizer()
   ():
     self.tokenizer.tokenize(text)

text = """This is an introduction.
This is a detailed discussion on the topic."""
chunker = TopicSegmentationChunking()
(chunker.chunk(text))

```

Segments text into chunks of a fixed word count.
```
 :
   ():
    self.chunk_size = chunk_size
   ():
    words = text.split()
     [.join(words[i:i + self.chunk_size])  i  (, (words), self.chunk_size)]

text = "This is a long text with many words to be chunked into fixed sizes."
chunker = FixedLengthWordChunking(chunk_size=)
(chunker.chunk(text))

```

Generates overlapping chunks for better contextual coherence.
```
 :
   ():
    self.window_size = window_size
    self.step = step
   ():
    words = text.split()
    chunks = []
     i  (, (words) - self.window_size + , self.step):
      chunks.append(.join(words[i:i + self.window_size]))
     chunks

text = "This is a long text to demonstrate sliding window chunking."
chunker = SlidingWindowChunking(window_size=, step=)
(chunker.chunk(text))

```

### Combining Chunking with Cosine Similarity
To enhance the relevance of extracted content, chunking strategies can be paired with cosine similarity techniques. Hereâ€™s an example workflow:
```
 sklearn.feature_extraction.text  TfidfVectorizer
 sklearn.metrics.pairwise  cosine_similarity
 :
   ():
    self.query = query
    self.vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
   ():
    vectors = self.vectorizer.fit_transform([self.query] + chunks)
    similarities = cosine_similarity(vectors[:], vectors[:]).flatten()
     [(chunks[i], similarities[i])  i  ((chunks))]

text = """This is a sample document. It has multiple sentences. 
We are testing chunking and similarity."""
chunker = SlidingWindowChunking(window_size=, step=)
chunks = chunker.chunk(text)
query = 
extractor = CosineSimilarityExtractor(query)
relevant_chunks = extractor.find_relevant_chunks(chunks)
(relevant_chunks)

```
