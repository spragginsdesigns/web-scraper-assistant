# Preserve Your Identity with Crawl4AI
Crawl4AI empowers you to navigate and interact with the web using your , ensuring you’re recognized as a human and not mistaken for a bot. This tutorial covers:
1. – The recommended approach for persistent profiles and identity-based crawling. 2. – A simplified fallback solution for quick automation without persistent identity.
## 1. Managed Browsers: Your Digital Identity Solution
let developers create and use . These profiles store local storage, cookies, and other session data, letting you browse as your —complete with logins, preferences, and cookies.
  * : Retain session data and browser fingerprints as though you’re a normal user. 
  * : Once you log in or solve CAPTCHAs in your chosen data directory, you can re-run crawls without repeating those steps. 
  * : If you can see the data in your own browser, you can automate its retrieval with your genuine identity.


Below is a to your tutorial, specifically the section about using binary rather than a system-wide Chrome/Edge. We’ll show how to that binary and launch it with a argument to set up your profile. You can then point to that folder for subsequent crawls.
### Creating a User Data Directory (Command-Line Approach via Playwright)
If you installed Crawl4AI (which installs Playwright under the hood), you already have a Playwright-managed Chromium on your system. Follow these steps to launch that from your command line, specifying a data directory:
1. the Playwright Chromium binary: - On most systems, installed browsers go under a folder or similar path. - To see an overview of installed browsers, run: 
or (depending on your environment). This shows where Playwright keeps Chromium. 
  * For instance, you might see a path like: on Linux, or a corresponding folder on macOS/Windows.


2. the Playwright Chromium binary with a user-data directory: 
```

~/.cache/ms-playwright/chromium-1234/chrome-linux/chrome \
  --user-data-dir=/home/<you>/my_chrome_profile

```

```

 ^
  --user-data-=

```

the path with the actual subfolder indicated in your cache structure. - This a fresh Chromium with your new or existing data folder. - any sites or configure your browser the way you want. - when done—your profile data is saved in that folder.
```
 crawl4ai  AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig
browser_config = BrowserConfig(
  headless=,
  use_managed_browser=,
  user_data_dir=,
  browser_type=
)

```

- Next time you run your code, it reuses that folder— your session data, cookies, local storage, etc. 
## 3. Using Managed Browsers in Crawl4AI
Once you have a data directory with your session data, pass it to :
```
 asyncio
 crawl4ai  AsyncWebCrawler, BrowserConfig, CrawlerRunConfig
  ():
  # 1) Reference your persistent data directory
  browser_config = BrowserConfig(
    headless=,       # 'True' for automated runs
    verbose=,
    use_managed_browser=, # Enables persistent browser strategy
    browser_type=,
    user_data_dir=
  )
  # 2) Standard crawl config
  crawl_config = CrawlerRunConfig(
    wait_for=
  )
    AsyncWebCrawler(config=browser_config)  crawler:
    result =  crawler.arun(url=, config=crawl_config)
     result.success:
      ("Successfully accessed private data with your identity!")
    :
      (, result.error_message)
 __name__ == :
  asyncio.run(main())

```

1. externally (via CLI or your normal Chrome with ). 2. that browser. 3. the same folder in in Crawl4AI. 4. – The site sees your identity as if you’re the same user who just logged in.
## 4. Magic Mode: Simplified Automation
If you need a persistent profile or identity-based approach, offers a quick way to simulate human-like browsing without storing long-term data.
```
 crawl4ai  AsyncWebCrawler, CrawlerRunConfig
  AsyncWebCrawler()  crawler:
  result =  crawler.arun(
    url=,
    config=CrawlerRunConfig(
      magic=, # Simplifies a lot of interaction
      remove_overlay_elements=,
      page_timeout=
    )
  )

```

  * Randomizes user agent & navigator


it’s no substitute for user-based sessions if you want a fully legitimate identity-based solution.
## 5. Comparing Managed Browsers vs. Magic Mode
Full localStorage/cookies retained in user_data_dir | No persistent data (fresh each run)  
---|---  
Real user profile with full rights & preferences | Emulated user-like patterns, but no actual identity  
Best for login-gated sites or heavy config | Simple tasks, minimal login or config needed  
External creation of user_data_dir, then use in Crawl4AI  
Extremely consistent (same data across runs) | Good for smaller tasks, can be less stable  
  * your user-data directory by launching Chrome/Chromium externally with . 
  * or configure sites as needed, then close the browser. 
  * Enjoy sessions that reflect your real identity. 
  * If you only need quick, ephemeral automation, might suffice.


: Always prefer a for robust, identity-based crawling and simpler interactions with complex sites. Use for quick tasks or prototypes where persistent data is unnecessary.
With these approaches, you preserve your browsing environment, ensuring the site sees you exactly as a normal user—no repeated logins or wasted time.
